At 8am use the temperature sensor to check the outdoor temperature. If the temp is under 90 degrees and above 40 degrees just turn off all heating and AC. if not then change the Thermostat to have the limits be 55 low and 82 high. at 3pm then change the thermostat to be low of 64 and high of 72.

If I select yes, the car will run until there is no frost detected and then shut off.",0.0043,0.0018,0.0045,0.0229,0.0151,0.0139,0.0,0.0013,0.0013,0.0051,0.0,0.0086,0.0,0.0187,0.0033,0.0,0.0,0.0102,0.0058,0.012,0.0056,0.01,0.0085,0.0483,0.0,0.0153,0.0284,0.0025,0.0018,0.0091,0.003,0.0,0.0028,0.0,0.0046,0.0045,0.0084,0.0,0.0072,0.0132,0.0059,0.0377,0.0266,0.0045,0.0059,0.0,0.0101,0.0,0.0063,0.0244,0.0131,0.0058,0.0117,0.0072,0.0212,0.0126,0.0525,0.0,1.0,0.0037,0.002,0.0029,0.0,0.0091,0.0116,0.0038,0.0,0.012,0.0052,0.0028,0.0055,0.0048,0.0028,0.0,0.0,0.0038,0.0095,0.0027,0.0019,0.012,0.0,0.0095,0.0201,0.0,0.014,0.0,0.0,0.0061,0.0034,0.0178,0.0056,0.0036,0.0038,0.0,0.0,0.0066,0.0014,0.0096,0.0055,0.0116,0.0022,0.015,0.0021,0.0032,0.0,0.005,0.0019,0.0051,0.0207,0.0,0.0382,0.0042,0.0173,0.0,0.0,0.0033,0.0026,0.0122,0.0018,0.0204,0.0041,0.0135,0.0,0.0027,0.0042,0.0047,0.0087,0.0,0.0,0.0014,0.0108,0.0014,0.0,0.0065,0.0,0.0072,0.0,0.0035,0.0125,0.011,0.0086,0.0089,0.0068,0.011,0.0017,0.0114,0.0,0.0199,0.011,0.0018,0.0062,0.0138,0.0044,0.0011,0.0026,0.0042,0.003,0.0151,0.0039,0.0122,0.0069,0.0052,0.0013,0.0013,0.0052,0.0036,0.0009,0.006,0.0031,0.0,0.0334,0.0085,0.0065,0.0052,0.0111,0.0062,0.0017,0.0085,0.0083,0.0156,0.0059,0.0,0.013,0.0085,0.0,0.0043,0.0021,0.0,0.0072,0.0031,0.006,0.0302,0.0071,0.0198,0.0069,0.004,0.0103,0.005,0.0077,0.0069,0.0281,0.0073,0.0022,0.0277,0.0059,0.0065,0.0,0.0091,0.0062,0.0099,0.0107,0.0313,0.0024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0129,0.0023,0.0,0.0039,0.0118,0.0024,0.0038,0.0,0.0061,0.0106,0.0049,0.0123,0.0019,0.0,0.0074,0.0093,0.009,0.0139,0.0117,0.0037,0.0054,0.0031,0.0,0.0024,0.0052,0.0032,0.009,0.0013,0.0095,0.0,0.017,0.0,0.016,0.0135,0.0104,0.004,0.0,0.0016,0.0022,0.0,0.0037,0.0048,0.0074,0.0,0.0131,0.0078,0.0,0.0033,0.0097,0.005,0.0052,0.0086,0.0,0.0666,0.0071,0.0058,0.0101,0.0,0.0232,0.0291,0.0051,0.0,0.0,0.0082,0.0101,0.0066,0.0067,0.0114,0.0,0.0061,0.0078,0.0,0.0,0.0132,0.0103,0.0,0.0101,0.0,0.0074,0.0171,0.0038,0.0015,0.0016,0.0094,0.0015,0.0,0.0319,0.0073

"If I'm not at home I would like for my security system to be able to detect motion outside. I want it to be able to detect motion of anyone or anything that steps foot in my yard and isn't me.

Then I am in control of whether or not someone has acces to my home.,0.0,0.0197,0.006,0.0326,0.0,0.0041,0.0038,0.0367,0.009,0.0066,0.0054,0.0152,0.0,0.0,0.0056,0.0156,0.0259,0.0038,0.0026,0.0032,0.0036,0.004,0.0324,0.0158,0.0143,0.0155,0.009,0.0,0.0,0.011,0.0114,0.0,0.0076,0.0132,0.0027,0.0157,0.0094,0.0087,0.014,0.0309,0.0198,0.0078,0.0129,0.0063,0.0114,0.0106,0.0181,0.0057,0.0133,0.013,0.0123,0.0129,0.0268,0.0026,0.0073,0.0113,0.0092,0.0363,0.0178,0.0175,0.0161,0.0071,0.0303,0.0041,0.0,0.0353,0.0094,0.0077,0.0322,0.0,0.0083,0.0105,0.0,0.008,0.0102,0.0133,0.0,0.0108,0.0046,0.0061,0.0,0.0371,0.0084,0.0184,0.0046,0.011,0.0187,0.0228,0.0061,1.0,0.0053,0.0036,0.0,0.0037,0.0342,0.0147,0.0032,0.0054,0.0,0.0171,0.0198,0.0162,0.0129,0.0,0.0199,0.0,0.0106,0.0189,0.0086,0.0228,0.0048,0.0153,0.0151,0.0,0.0381,0.0041,0.0059,0.0042,0.007,0.0,0.0088,0.011,0.0066,0.0307,0.0085,0.0042,0.0359,0.0207,0.0175,0.0034,0.0,0.0272,0.0095,0.0129,0.0,0.0109,0.0044,0.0077,0.0,0.02,0.0042,0.0033,0.0443,0.0184,0.0,0.01,0.0039,0.0,0.0,0.0235,0.0027,0.0151,0.0148,0.0235,0.0026,0.008,0.0066,0.0172,0.0095,0.0146,0.0097,0.0035,0.0145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015,0.0111,0.0,0.013,0.0179,0.0032,0.0082,0.0034,0.0197,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0188,0.0043,0.0142,0.0085,0.0194,0.0092,0.0052,0.0039,0.0188,0.0018,0.0184,0.0,0.0527,0.0,0.0043,0.0035,0.014,0.0278,0.0073,0.0064,0.0123,0.0,0.0041,0.0161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0173,0.0024,0.0,0.0,0.0121,0.0054,0.0192,0.0163,0.0,0.0169,0.0122,0.0,0.0055,0.005,0.0048,0.0067,0.0139,0.012,0.004,0.0196,0.0085,0.0244,0.0084,0.0119,0.0148,0.0165,0.022,0.0252,0.0,0.0174,0.0035,0.0028,0.0154,0.0115,0.0067,0.0135,0.0152,0.0112,0.0,0.0115,0.0036,0.0091,0.02,0.0108,0.0036,0.0,0.007,0.0166,0.0,0.0079,0.0204,0.0077,0.0298,0.0308,0.0,0.0116,0.0202,0.0073,0.0116,0.0118,0.0043,0.0,0.0114,0.015,0.0073,0.0171,0.0143,0.0095,0.0078,0.0032,0.0,0.0045,0.0072,0.0051,0.0049,0.0218,0.0177,0.0168,0.0134,0.0,0.0054,0.0,0.0076,0.0053,0.007,0.0061,0.0575,0.0,0.0087,0.0036,0.0071,0.0,0.0058,0.0131,0.0,0.0,0.0071,0.0,0.0105

When someone approaches the garage door from inside  I would like the sensor to open the garage door. This would be helpful for my son when he takes out the trash because he wouldn't have to set the bags down to open the garage door. It would also be helpful for me when I need to leave because I walk around the car and pass the garage door. I would also like the vacuum to start when the doors lock in the morning.

I am at work and have set my Motion Sensor at home to turn on and my IP Camera to take any shots when notified by the motion sensor.  It is 4:00pm and I'm getting ready to leave to go home when I receive notification of some movement in the backyard of my house next to the garage.  I am able to access to footage to see if someone is breaking in.  It turns out the wind has picked up and blew some brush against the house.

Set up your lighting to mimic the outdoors. Gradually wake up to sunrise lighting in the morning and in the evening relax  and recharge as the lighting changes to a sunset. You can also program the lights to do different things according to your activities. For instance you could have high lighting when the kids come home from school and are doing homework. Then you could have low lighting programmed in for after dinner activities.,0.0,0.0009,0.0065,0.0083,0.0,0.0,0.0103,0.0007,0.0065,0.0,0.0073,0.0062,0.0,0.0021,0.0012,0.0,0.0028,0.0,0.0063,0.0052,0.0056,0.0,0.0008,0.0,0.0128,0.0,0.0028,0.0014,0.0,0.0116,0.0098,0.0095,0.0159,0.006,0.0,0.0018,0.0074,0.0007,0.0078,0.0,0.0028,0.0021,0.0035,0.0006,0.0007,0.004,0.0043,0.0021,0.0,0.0092,0.0028,0.0022,0.0023,0.0082,0.0208,0.0025,0.012,0.0107,0.0026,0.0014,0.0007,0.0051,0.003,0.0009,0.0,0.0017,0.003,0.0,0.0006,0.0,0.0039,0.0141,0.0285,0.0249,0.0055,0.0036,0.0,0.0,0.001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033,0.0023,0.0093,0.003,0.0051,0.0026,0.0031,0.0028,0.0,0.0045,0.001,0.0006,0.0083,0.0012,0.0026,0.0,0.0009,0.0,0.0,0.0065,0.001,0.0056,0.0,0.0355,0.0038,0.0071,0.0,0.0,0.0016,0.0,0.0066,0.0033,0.0,0.0,0.0096,0.0042,0.0007,0.008,0.0031,0.0046,0.0,0.0021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006,0.0,0.0018,0.0,0.0162,0.0018,0.0015,0.0078,0.0016,0.0025,0.0,0.0048,0.0019,0.0031,0.0057,0.0021,0.0,0.015,0.0044,0.0,0.0018,0.0017,0.0033,0.0151,0.0026,1.0,0.0055,0.0014,0.0079,0.0022,0.0005,0.0,0.0029,0.0007,0.0033,0.006,0.0,0.0327,0.004,0.0,0.0006,0.0016,0.0054,0.0009,0.0053,0.0018,0.0,0.0034,0.0062,0.0,0.0095,0.0011,0.0594,0.0119,0.0,0.0035,0.005,0.0,0.0034,0.0031,0.0283,0.004,0.0037,0.0,0.0025,0.0015,0.0015,0.0008,0.0084,0.0016,0.0055,0.0023,0.0027,0.0,0.0,0.0048,0.0043,0.0,0.0028,0.0,0.0066,0.015,0.0036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0149,0.0016,0.0012,0.0,0.001,0.0146,0.0166,0.0112,0.0021,0.0028,0.0016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033,0.0019,0.0042,0.0022,0.0,0.0006,0.007,0.0039,0.0019,0.0028,0.0009,0.0,0.0045,0.0048,0.0044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.001,0.0,0.0021,0.0111,0.0021,0.0021,0.0,0.0029,0.0107,0.0006,0.0,0.0025,0.0,0.005,0.0011,0.0008,0.0017,0.0139,0.0022,0.0,0.0042,0.0,0.0,0.0032,0.0,0.0034,0.001,0.0,0.0242,0.0059,0.0097,0.0011,0.0,0.0,0.0025,0.0013,0.0044,0.0,0.0028,0.0031,0.0,0.0091,0.0,0.0,0.0011,0.0056,0.0091,0.0,0.0127,0.0,0.0006,0.0008,0.0,0.0018,0.0,0.0061,0.0039

I need to be able to see what is going on and I like the lights to be on so that I can find them easily in the dark.,0.004,0.0048,0.0105,0.0073,0.0153,0.0035,0.0107,0.0054,0.0038,0.0023,0.019,0.0293,0.0057,0.0,0.0095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0159,0.0121,0.0062,0.0,0.0,0.019,0.0114,0.0,0.0069,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0012,0.005,0.0063,0.0068,0.0148,0.0017,0.0243,0.0123,0.0068,0.0,0.0015,0.0018,0.0116,0.0031,0.0,0.0048,0.0048,0.0083,0.0077,0.0044,0.0123,0.0026,0.0012,0.0,0.0088,0.0119,0.005,0.0,0.0054,0.0,0.0029,0.0061,0.0145,0.0,0.0,0.0143,0.0118,0.0053,0.0028,0.0069,0.0028,0.0,0.0071,0.0048,0.0135,0.0036,0.0316,0.0,0.0031,0.0,0.0022,0.009,0.0,0.0,0.015,0.0,0.001,0.0025,0.0108,0.0028,0.0111,0.0049,0.0032,0.0158,0.0019,0.002,0.0267,0.0,0.0087,0.0121,0.0,0.0,0.0091,0.0249,0.0118,0.0029,0.0,0.0092,0.0067,0.0055,0.0,0.0155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0325,0.0024,0.0,0.0107,0.0243,0.0028,0.0096,0.0,0.0098,0.0084,0.0289,0.0031,0.0048,0.008,0.0,0.0052,0.0023,0.0033,0.025,0.0141,0.0145,0.0071,0.0062,0.0044,0.0,0.0047,0.0013,0.0081,0.0,0.0052,0.0044,0.0033,0.0118,0.0036,0.007,0.002,0.0065,0.003,0.0084,0.0039,0.0072,0.0148,0.0104,0.0,0.0062,0.0,0.0081,0.0095,0.012,0.0113,0.0036,0.0219,0.0,0.0051,0.0,0.0,0.0049,0.0,0.0023,0.0024,0.0,0.0064,0.009,0.019,0.0048,0.0,0.0168,0.0049,0.0,0.0045,0.0434,0.0,0.0085,0.0016,0.0092,0.0025,0.0045,0.0,0.0053,0.0,0.0142,0.0073,0.0159,0.0102,0.0,0.0061,0.0,0.0,0.0091,0.0055,0.0049,0.0038,0.0,0.005,0.0124,0.0087,0.0022,0.0227,0.016,0.0,0.0,0.0168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0018,0.0361,0.0066,0.0,0.0,0.0058,0.0059,0.0086,0.0047,0.0253,0.0,0.0157,0.0086,0.0114,0.0215,0.0029,1.0,0.0086,0.0416,0.0,0.0,0.0343,0.0028,0.0049,0.0049,0.0015,0.0035,0.0031,0.0059,0.0038,0.0,0.0173,0.0141,0.0101,0.0102,0.0047,0.0107,0.0059,0.0032,0.0,0.0022,0.002,0.0,0.0053,0.0222,0.0073,0.0109,0.015,0.0058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0081,0.0081,0.0,0.0103,0.0,0.003,0.0034,0.008,0.0053,0.0,0.0,0.0114,0.0044,0.005,0.0066,0.0,0.0061,0.0,0.0147,0.0054,0.0041,0.0053,0.0071,0.0,0.0065,0.004,0.0032,0.0113,0.003,0.0118,0.0065,0.0067

I plan on traveling for a large amount of time this summer.  I want the water sensor to trigger if any water starts to collect in my basement.  It will activate a camera feed and send me an email.  I can then call a repair person or relative to fix the problem.  This will prevent my basement from getting wet and moldy while I am away.,0.0049,0.0014,0.0037,0.0089,0.0,0.0013,0.0,0.0041,0.0068,0.0155,0.0061,0.0037,0.0,0.0,0.0043,0.0081,0.0442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0018,0.0065,0.0044,0.007,0.0,0.0036,0.0039,0.0012,0.0041,0.0015,0.0085,0.003,0.0008,0.006,0.0042,0.0021,0.0,0.0,0.0137,0.0135,0.0193,0.0013,0.0042,0.0123,0.0224,0.0,0.0063,0.0011,0.0311,0.0035,0.0075,0.0056,0.0063,0.0013,0.006,0.0014,0.0058,0.0051,0.0052,0.0103,0.0056,0.0,0.0176,0.0,0.0,0.0098,0.0044,0.0038,0.0154,0.0,0.002,0.0,0.003,0.0,0.0029,0.0013,0.005,0.0065,0.0,0.003,0.0034,0.0205,0.004,0.0052,0.0,0.0062,0.0056,0.01,0.0,0.0135,0.0027,0.0018,0.0,0.0,0.0094,0.0127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0054,0.0043,0.0019,0.0132,0.0076,0.0049,0.0,0.006,0.0,0.0026,0.0028,0.0108,0.0102,0.0037,0.0,0.0188,0.0,0.0203,0.0,0.0,0.0035,0.0179,0.0046,0.0,0.006,0.038,0.0021,0.0116,0.0064,0.0118,0.0,0.0,0.015,0.0061,0.0063,0.0,0.0033,0.0022,0.0,0.0223,0.0433,0.009,0.0086,0.004,0.007,0.0072,0.015,0.0,0.0098,0.0,0.0091,0.0121,0.0008,0.0042,0.0073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0049,0.0032,0.0558,0.0053,0.0103,0.0072,0.0,0.0091,0.0,0.0008,0.0027,0.0,0.0033,0.0051,0.0016,0.0293,0.0017,0.0106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0025,0.0021,0.0156,0.0035,0.0135,0.0111,0.0017,0.0,0.0016,0.0,0.01,0.0054,0.0081,0.0,0.0167,0.0,0.0017,0.0279,0.0012,0.0061,0.0025,0.0091,0.0,0.0046,0.005,0.0,0.0029,0.0027,0.0148,0.0,0.0,0.004,0.0,0.0193,0.0039,0.0,0.0,0.0094,0.0039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0059,0.0023,0.0,0.0026,0.0048,0.0068,0.0111,0.0062,0.0051,0.0067,0.0065,0.0047,0.0036,0.0501,0.0151,0.0066,0.0,0.0066,0.0076,0.0031,1.0,0.0042,0.021,0.0035,0.0028,0.0012,0.0531,0.0015,0.0077,0.0,0.0,0.0017,0.0082,0.0,0.0034,0.013,0.0218,0.0053,0.0134,0.0,0.0065,0.0043,0.0122,0.0,0.0014,0.0014,0.0,0.0105,0.0,0.0036,0.0,0.0057,0.0,0.0031,0.0017,0.0013,0.0044,0.0046,0.0,0.0054,0.0101,0.0058,0.004,0.0139,0.0,0.0027,0.0,0.0226,0.0101,0.0067,0.0,0.0031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0018,0.0231,0.0023,0.0059

"I would use the IFTTT feature to schedule my vacuum cleaner to run at 9:00AM every morning.  When I am getting ready for work, I don't have a lot of time to clean up the messes that I have made.
